# 1st project:

1) Can I see the optimality cut as a knapsack constraint?

2) Can I derive valid inequalities to cut relaxed solutions?

instance jopt T = 2

relaxed solution

y~1_2 = 0.5
y~1_3 = 0.5
y~2_1 = 0.5
y~2_4 = 0.5
x~0_1_2_A = 0.5
x~0_1_3_B = 0.5
x~0_1_2_C = 0.5
x~0_1_3_C = 0.5
x~0_2_1_A = 0.5
x~0_2_1_B = 0.5
x~1_2_4_A = 0.5
x~1_2_4_B = 0.5
x~1_2_4_C = 0.5
x~1_3_2_C = 0.5
x~2_3_4_A = 1.0
x~2_3_4_B = 1.0
x~2_3_4_C = 0.5

optimal solution

y~1_1 = 1.0
y~2_4 = 1.0
x~0_1_1_A = 1.0
x~0_1_1_B = 1.0
x~0_2_4_C = 1.0
x~1_2_4_A = 1.0
x~1_2_4_B = 1.0
x~2_3_1_A = 1.0
x~2_3_1_B = 1.0
x~2_3_3_C = 1.0
